    <h2>Chicken Biryani</h2>
    <p>Biryani in India doesn't just mean biryani. There are variations across the length and breadth of the country. 
        There is Hyderabadi biryani (which is what I'm sharing today) where the biryani has a lot of gravy or masala and is cooked slowly
        with rice in a sealed pot. Then there is the Muslim wedding biryani which actually has lesser masala, but packed with flavour mostly from whole spices; the Kerala biryani,
         donne biryani from Karnataka and so many more.
